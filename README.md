Self-study notes for Andrej Karpathy's micrograd lecture

- Source code: [link](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd)

## notes 
Even though the concepts here are pretty simple and most ML engineers are probably already familiar with them, I had a blast going over everything from computational graphs to backprop and building simple neural networks from scratch. I tweaked a small part of the original source code just for fun, to play around with the code base. The unit tests are different from the original ones too, because I wanted to create them myself, just to deepen my understanding.

## tests 
```bash 
python -m pytest 
```
